Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope
All men are created equal
Everybody can be great
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are
Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige
You express the truth of your character with the choice of your actions
Watch your thoughts; for they become words
Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner
Take a method and try it
It is a grand thing to rise in the world
You may be whatever you resolve to be
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world
Carry good cheer in the morning;
Carry good cheer in the night
May you always be blessed with walls for the wind
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right
I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer
The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves
There is no mistaking love
The love we give away is the only love we keep
Love is always bestowed as a gift—freely, willingly, and without expectation
Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  #<Author:0x00007f44f0082b40>
I sustain myself with the love of family
Families are the compass that guides us
We must take care of our families wherever we find them
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one
Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness
Let your joy be in your journey—not in some distant goal
The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun
The essence of life is not in the great victories and grand failures, but in the simple joys
I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peace—a connection to what matters
